%% Possible options:
%% undergrad -- If you're writing an undergraduate thesis. There will then
%%              be no exam committee approval (even if you have specified
%%              examcommapproval), and the wordings of the supervisory
%%              committee approval will be different. Remember to specify
%%              your \faculty and \bachprogramme if using this option.
%% newtx --     Loads the newtxtext and newtxmath font packages if these
%%              packages are installed; they have nicer math fonts.
%%              Otherwise mathptmx will be loaded as default.
%% microtype -- Even nicer typographic output! Reduces chances of hyphenation
%%              but *sometimes* (though rare) may cause an endless loop as
%%              the typesetting engine tries to find an optimal line break.
